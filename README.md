🚨 Fraud Detection Decision System

An end-to-end fraud detection decision system that mirrors how real financial institutions detect, evaluate, and act on fraudulent transactions.

This project goes beyond model accuracy and focuses on business-aware decision-making under extreme class imbalance, explainability, and production-ready deployment.

🔗 Live Demo & API

Backend API (FastAPI – deployed on Render):
👉 https://fraud-detection-system-2-7ake.onrender.com

Interactive Swagger Documentation:
👉 https://fraud-detection-system-2-7ake.onrender.com/docs

Streamlit Dashboard (Analyst Demo – Optional UI):
👉 https://fraud-detection-system-o9s4mqdukjhr5cghkqcasv.streamlit.app/
(Analyst-facing demonstration layer; not the core system)

⚠️ The FastAPI service is the core fraud decision engine.
The Streamlit app is an optional demo/analyst interface built on top of the API.

🧠 Problem Framing (Why This Project Is Different)

Fraud detection is not a prediction problem — it is a decision problem.

Fraud is extremely rare (~0.17%)

Missing fraud → direct financial loss

Blocking genuine users → customer dissatisfaction

Accuracy alone is misleading and dangerous

🎯 Goal

Minimize total business cost while maintaining customer trust — not maximize accuracy.

📊 Dataset

Credit Card Fraud Dataset (UCI / Kaggle)

284,807 transactions

492 fraud cases (~0.17%)

PCA-anonymized features for privacy compliance

The dataset is not included in this repository.

🤖 Models Implemented
Model	Purpose
Logistic Regression	Baseline
Weighted Logistic Regression	Cost-sensitive baseline
Random Forest	Conservative, high precision
XGBoost	Best recall–precision balance
Isolation Forest	Novel / emerging fraud detection
⚖️ Handling Class Imbalance

Techniques used:

Class weighting

SMOTE (for experimentation)

Imbalance-aware tree models

Threshold tuning (instead of label tuning)

💰 Business Cost Optimization

Instead of using a fixed 0.5 threshold, the decision threshold is optimized using business cost:

Outcome	Cost
Fraud missed (False Negative)	₹10,000
Genuine blocked (False Positive)	₹200

The selected threshold minimizes expected total cost, not classification error.

🔍 Explainability (SHAP)

Global explanations: Identify key fraud-driving features

Local explanations: Explain why a specific transaction was flagged

Makes the system suitable for regulated financial environments

🧠 Key Design Decisions

API-first design to reflect real fraud systems

Optimized decisions using business cost, not accuracy

Used SHAP for transparency and auditability

Treated UI as optional, not core system logic
